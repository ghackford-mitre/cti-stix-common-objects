            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: brcmfmac: Fix oops due to NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw()\n\nThis patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference bug in brcmfmac that occurs\nwhen a high 'sd_sgentry_align' value applies (e.g. 512) and a lot of queued SKBs\nare sent from the pkt queue.\n\nThe problem is the number of entries in the pre-allocated sgtable, it is\nnents = max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) + max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) >> 4 + 1.\nGiven the default [rt]xglom_size=32 it's actually 35 which is too small.\nWorst case, the pkt queue can end up with 64 SKBs. This occurs when a new SKB\nis added for each original SKB if tailroom isn't enough to hold tail_pad.\nAt least one sg entry is needed for each SKB. So, eventually the \"skb_queue_walk loop\"\nin brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw may run out of sg entries. This makes sg_next return\nNULL and this causes the oops.\n\nThe patch sets nents to max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) * 2 to be able handle\nthe worst-case.\nBtw. this requires only 64-35=29 * 16 (or 20 if CONFIG_NEED_SG_DMA_LENGTH) = 464\nadditional bytes of memory.",
