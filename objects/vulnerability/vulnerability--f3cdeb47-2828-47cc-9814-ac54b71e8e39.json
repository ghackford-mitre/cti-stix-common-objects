The close operations are\ncompleted using the task work mechanism -- which means the thread\nneeds to return to userspace or the file object may never be\ndereferenced -- which can lead to hung processes.\n\nForce the binder thread back to userspace if an fd is closed during\nBC_FREE_BUFFER handling.",
