            "description": "AList is a file list program that supports multiple storages. AList contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in helper.go. The endpoint /i/:link_name takes in a user-provided value and reflects it back in the response. The endpoint returns an application/xml response, opening it up to HTML tags via XHTML and thus leading to a XSS vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.29.0.",
