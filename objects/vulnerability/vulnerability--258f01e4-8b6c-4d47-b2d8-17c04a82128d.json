            "description": "iPerf3 before 3.17, when used with OpenSSL before 3.2.0 as a server with RSA authentication, allows a timing side channel in RSA decryption operations. This side channel could be sufficient for an attacker to recover credential plaintext. It requires the attacker to send a large number of messages for decryption, as described in \"Everlasting ROBOT: the Marvin Attack\" by Hubert Kario.",
