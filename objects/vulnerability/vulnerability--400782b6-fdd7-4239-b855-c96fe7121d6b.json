            "description": "The Void Contact Form 7 Widget For Elementor Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'cf7_redirect_page' attribute within the plugin's Void Contact From 7 widget in all versions up to, and including, 2.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
