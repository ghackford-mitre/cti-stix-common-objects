            "description": "A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol for VPN termination of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
