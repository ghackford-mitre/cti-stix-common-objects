            "description": "The Pocket News Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the option_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
