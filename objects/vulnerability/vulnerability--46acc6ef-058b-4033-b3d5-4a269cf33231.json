            "description": "The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'view-attendance' page in all versions up to, and including, 92.0.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query in the mj_smgt_view_student_attendance() function.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Student-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",
