            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetlabel: Fix NULL pointer exception caused by CALIPSO on IPv4 sockets\n\nWhen calling netlbl_conn_setattr(), addr->sa_family is used\nto determine the function behavior. If sk is an IPv4 socket,\nbut the connect function is called with an IPv6 address,\nthe function calipso_sock_setattr() is triggered.\nInside this function, the following code is executed:\n\nsk_fullsock(__sk) ? inet_sk(__sk)->pinet6 : NULL;\n\nSince sk is an IPv4 socket, pinet6 is NULL, leading to a\nnull pointer dereference.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by checking if inet6_sk(sk)\nreturns a NULL pointer before accessing pinet6.",
