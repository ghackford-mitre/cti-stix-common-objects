            "description": "The Binary MLM Woocommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'bmw_display_pv_set_page' function and insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'product_points' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
