            "description": "reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. In versions 1.2.0 through 2.1.1, an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the WAF detection tool allows an authenticated attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands as root user. The URL query parameter `url` is passed to `subprocess.check_output` without any sanitization, resulting in a command injection vulnerability. This API endpoint is accessible by authenticated users with any use role. Because the process runs as `root`, an attacker has root access. Commit edd3c85ee16f93804ad38dac5602549d2d30a93e contains a patch for the issue.",
