            "description": "qdrant/qdrant version 1.9.0-dev is vulnerable to path traversal due to improper input validation in the `/collections/{name}/snapshots/upload` endpoint. By manipulating the `name` parameter through URL encoding, an attacker can upload a file to an arbitrary location on the system, such as `/root/poc.txt`. This vulnerability allows for the writing and overwriting of arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to a full takeover of the system. The issue is fixed in version 1.9.0.",
