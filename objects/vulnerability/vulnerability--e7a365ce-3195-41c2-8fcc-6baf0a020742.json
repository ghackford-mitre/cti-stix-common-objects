            "description": "An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in the advanced forwarding management process aftman of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10E, MPC11, MX10K-LC9600 line cards, MX304, and EX9200-15C, may allow an attacker to exploit a stack-based buffer overflow, leading to a reboot of the FPC.\n\nThrough code review, it was determined that the interface definition code for aftman could read beyond a buffer boundary, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.\nThis issue affects Junos OS on MX Series and EX9200-15C:\n\n\n  *  from 21.2 before 21.2R3-S1, \n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3, \n  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R2, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R2; \n\n\n\n\nThis issue does not affect:\n\n\n\n  *  versions of Junos OS prior to 20.3R1;\n  *  any version of Junos OS 20.4.\n\n\n",
