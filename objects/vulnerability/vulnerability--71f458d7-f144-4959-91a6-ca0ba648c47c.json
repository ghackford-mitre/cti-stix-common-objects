            "description": "The WooCommerce Multiple Free Gift plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to gift manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to plugin not enforcing server-side checks on the products that can be added as a gift. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add non-gift items to their cart as a gift.",
