            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni3c: master: cdns: Fix use after free vulnerability in cdns_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition\n\nIn the cdns_i3c_master_probe function, &master->hj_work is bound with\ncdns_i3c_master_hj. And cdns_i3c_master_interrupt can call\ncnds_i3c_master_demux_ibis function to start the work.\n\nIf we remove the module which will call cdns_i3c_master_remove to\nmake cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregister\nwhile the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations\nthat may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:\n\nCPU0                                      CPU1\n\n                                     | cdns_i3c_master_hj\ncdns_i3c_master_remove               |\ni3c_master_unregister(&master->base) |\ndevice_unregister(&master->dev)      |\ndevice_release                       |\n//free master->base                  |\n                                     | i3c_master_do_daa(&master->base)\n                                     | //use master->base\n\nFix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with\nthe cleanup in cdns_i3c_master_remove.",
