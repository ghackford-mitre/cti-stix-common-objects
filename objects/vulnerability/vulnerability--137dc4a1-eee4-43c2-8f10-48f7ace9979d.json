            "description": "changedetection.io is a free open source web page change detection, website watcher, restock monitor and notification service. Improper input validation in the application can allow attackers to perform local file read (LFR) or path traversal attacks. These vulnerabilities occur when user input is used to construct file paths without adequate sanitization or validation. For example, using file:../../../etc/passwd or file: ///etc/passwd can bypass weak validations and allow unauthorized access to sensitive files. Even though this has been addressed in previous patch, it is still insufficient. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.05.",
