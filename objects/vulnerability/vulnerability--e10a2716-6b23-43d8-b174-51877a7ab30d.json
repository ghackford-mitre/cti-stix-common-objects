            "description": "The Website Article Monetization By MageNet plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'abp_auth_key' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.11 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping and a missing authorization check. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
