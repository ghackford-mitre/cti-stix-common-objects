            "description": "The AliExpress Dropshipping with AliNext Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ajax_save_image function in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
