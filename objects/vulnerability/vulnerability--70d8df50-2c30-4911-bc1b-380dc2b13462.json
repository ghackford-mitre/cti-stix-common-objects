            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibbpf: Handle size overflow for ringbuf mmap\n\nThe maximum size of ringbuf is 2GB on x86-64 host, so 2 * max_entries\nwill overflow u32 when mapping producer page and data pages. Only\ncasting max_entries to size_t is not enough, because for 32-bits\napplication on 64-bits kernel the size of read-only mmap region\nalso could overflow size_t.\n\nSo fixing it by casting the size of read-only mmap region into a __u64\nand checking whether or not there will be overflow during mmap.",
