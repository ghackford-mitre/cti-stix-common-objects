            "description": "Nimble Commander suffers from a privilege escalation vulnerability due to the server (info.filesmanager.Files.PrivilegedIOHelperV2) performing improper/insufficient validation of a clientâ€™s authorization before executing an operation. Consequently, it is possible to execute system-level commands as the root user, such as changing permissions and ownership, obtaining a handle (file descriptor) of an arbitrary file, and terminating processes, among other operations.",
