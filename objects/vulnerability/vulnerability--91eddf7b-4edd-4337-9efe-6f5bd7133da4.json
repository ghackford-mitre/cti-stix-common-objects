            "description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a \n\nDenial-of-Service (DoS).\n\n\nWhen a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.\n\n\n\nWhether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:\n\n> show ppm request-queue\n\n\nFPC     Pending-request\nfpc0                   2\nrequest-total-pending: 2\n\n\nwhere a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak. \n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS:\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8,\n  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S7,\n  *  22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S4,\n  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S4, \n  *  22.3 versions before 22.3R3,\n  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R2-S2, 22.4R3,\n  *  23.1 versions before 23.1R2.\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8-EVO,\n  *  21.4-EVO versions before 21.4R3-S7-EVO,\n  *  22.2-EVO versions before 22.2R3-S4-EVO,\n  *  22.3-EVO versions before 22.3R3-EVO,\n  *  22.4-EVO versions before 22.4R3-EVO,\n  *  23.2-EVO versions before 23.2R1-EVO.",
