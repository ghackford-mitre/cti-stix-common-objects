            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ena: Fix incorrect descriptor free behavior\n\nENA has two types of TX queues:\n- queues which only process TX packets arriving from the network stack\n- queues which only process TX packets forwarded to it by XDP_REDIRECT\n  or XDP_TX instructions\n\nThe ena_free_tx_bufs() cycles through all descriptors in a TX queue\nand unmaps + frees every descriptor that hasn't been acknowledged yet\nby the device (uncompleted TX transactions).\nThe function assumes that the processed TX queue is necessarily from\nthe first category listed above and ends up using napi_consume_skb()\nfor descriptors belonging to an XDP specific queue.\n\nThis patch solves a bug in which, in case of a VF reset, the\ndescriptors aren't freed correctly, leading to crashes.",
