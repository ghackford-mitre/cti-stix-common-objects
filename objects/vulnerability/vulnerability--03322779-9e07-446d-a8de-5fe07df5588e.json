Left\nunchecked this will firstly result in an OOB read in the form\n`if (str[0 - 1] == '\\n') followed closely by an OOB write in the form\n`str[0 - 1] = '\\0'`.\n\nThere is already a validating check to catch strings that are too long.\nLet's supply an additional check for invalid strings that are too short.",
