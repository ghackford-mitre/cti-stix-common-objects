            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: socket: Lookup orig tuple for IPv6 SNAT\n\nnf_sk_lookup_slow_v4 does the conntrack lookup for IPv4 packets to\nrestore the original 5-tuple in case of SNAT, to be able to find the\nright socket (if any). Then socket_match() can correctly check whether\nthe socket was transparent.\n\nHowever, the IPv6 counterpart (nf_sk_lookup_slow_v6) lacks this\nconntrack lookup, making xt_socket fail to match on the socket when the\npacket was SNATed. Add the same logic to nf_sk_lookup_slow_v6.\n\nIPv6 SNAT is used in Kubernetes clusters for pod-to-world packets, as\npods' addresses are in the fd00::/8 ULA subnet and need to be replaced\nwith the node's external address. Cilium leverages Envoy to enforce L7\npolicies, and Envoy uses transparent sockets. Cilium inserts an iptables\nprerouting rule that matches on `-m socket --transparent` and redirects\nthe packets to localhost, but it fails to match SNATed IPv6 packets due\nto that missing conntrack lookup.",
