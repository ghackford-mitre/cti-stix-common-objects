            "description": "GeoNetwork is a catalog application to manage spatially referenced resources. In versions prior to 4.2.10 and 4.4.5, the search end-point response headers contain information about Elasticsearch software in use. This information is valuable from a security point of view because it allows software used by the server to be easily identified. GeoNetwork 4.4.5 and 4.2.10 fix this issue. No known workarounds are available.",
