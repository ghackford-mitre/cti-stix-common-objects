            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet-auth: assign dh_key to NULL after kfree_sensitive\n\nctrl->dh_key might be used across multiple calls to nvmet_setup_dhgroup()\nfor the same controller. So it's better to nullify it after release on\nerror path in order to avoid double free later in nvmet_destroy_auth().\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Svace.",
