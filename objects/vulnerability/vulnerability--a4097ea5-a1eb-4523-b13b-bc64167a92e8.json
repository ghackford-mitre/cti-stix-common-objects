            "description": "Parallels Desktop Technical Data Reporter Link Following Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. \nThis vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the Technical Data Reporter component. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to change the permissions of arbitrary files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-25014.",
