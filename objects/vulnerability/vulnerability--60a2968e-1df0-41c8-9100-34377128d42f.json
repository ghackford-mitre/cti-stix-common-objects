            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nudp: fix race between close() and udp_abort()\n\nKaustubh reported and diagnosed a panic in udp_lib_lookup().\nThe root cause is udp_abort() racing with close(). Both\nracing functions acquire the socket lock, but udp{v6}_destroy_sock()\nrelease it before performing destructive actions.\n\nWe can't easily extend the socket lock scope to avoid the race,\ninstead use the SOCK_DEAD flag to prevent udp_abort from doing\nany action when the critical race happens.\n\nDiagnosed-and-tested-by: Kaustubh Pandey <kapandey@codeaurora.org>",
