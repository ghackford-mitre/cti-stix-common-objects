            "description": "An arbitrary file deletion vulnerability exists in the admin/del.php file at line 62 in ZZCMS 2023 and earlier. Due to insufficient validation and sanitization of user input for file paths, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to delete arbitrary files on the server. This can lead to the deletion of critical files, potentially disrupting the normal operation of the system.",
