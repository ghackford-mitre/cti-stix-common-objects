Affected SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager Clients do not properly check the integrity of update files. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to alter update files in transit and trick an authorized user into installing malicious code. \r\nA successful exploit requires the attacker to be able to modify the communication between server and client on the network.",
