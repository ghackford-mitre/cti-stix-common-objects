            "description": "SpiceDB is an open source database for scalably storing and querying fine-grained authorization data. Starting in version 1.35.0 and prior to version 1.37.1, clients that have enabled `LookupResources2` and have caveats in the evaluation path for their requests can return a permissionship of `CONDITIONAL` with context marked as missing, even then the context was supplied. LookupResources2 is the new default in SpiceDB 1.37.0 and has been opt-in since SpiceDB 1.35.0. The bug is patched as part of SpiceDB 1.37.1. As a workaround, disable LookupResources2 via the `--enable-experimental-lookup-resources` flag by setting it to `false`.",
