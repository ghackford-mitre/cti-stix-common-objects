An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to import a crafted XML file with malicious entries. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and write files within the affected application.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
