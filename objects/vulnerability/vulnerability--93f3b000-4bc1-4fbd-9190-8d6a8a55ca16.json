An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system.\r\nCisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
