            "description": "D-Link DIR-3040 HTTP Request Processing Referer Heap-Based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DIR-3040 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the prog.cgi binary, which handles HNAP requests made to the lighttpd webserver listening on TCP ports 80 and 443. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-21671.",
