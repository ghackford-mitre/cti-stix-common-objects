            "description": "A vulnerability in the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow when processing crafted RSVP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending RSVP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
