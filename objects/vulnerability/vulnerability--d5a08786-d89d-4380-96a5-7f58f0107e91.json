            "description": "The The Affiliate Super Assistent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.3. This is due to the software allowing users to supply arbitrary shortcodes in comments when the 'Parse comments' option is enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.",
