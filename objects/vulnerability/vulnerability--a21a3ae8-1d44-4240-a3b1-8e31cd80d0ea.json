An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by altering the request that is&nbsp;sent when uploading a Device Pack. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM on the underlying operating system of an affected device.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
