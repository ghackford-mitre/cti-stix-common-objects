            "description": "The ThemeGrill Demo Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass due to a missing capability check on the reset_wizard_actions function in versions 1.3.4 through 1.6.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to reset the WordPress database. After which, if there is a user named 'admin', the attacker will become automatically logged in as an administrator.",
