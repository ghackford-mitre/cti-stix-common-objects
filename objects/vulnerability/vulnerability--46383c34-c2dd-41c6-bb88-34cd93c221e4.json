            "description": "In Zammad 6.4.x before 6.4.2, SSRF can occur. Authenticated admin users can enable webhooks in Zammad, which are triggered as POST requests when certain conditions are met. If a webhook endpoint returned a redirect response, Zammad would follow it automatically with another GET request. This could be abused by an attacker to cause GET requests for example in the local network.",
