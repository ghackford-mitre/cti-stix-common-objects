            "description": "A vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication platform allows a low-privileged user with a specific role to exploit a method that updates critical configuration settings, such as modifying the trusted client certificate used for authentication on a specific port. This can result in unauthorized access, enabling the user to call privileged methods and initiate critical services. The issue arises due to insufficient permission requirements on the method, allowing users with low privileges to perform actions that should require higher-level permissions.",
