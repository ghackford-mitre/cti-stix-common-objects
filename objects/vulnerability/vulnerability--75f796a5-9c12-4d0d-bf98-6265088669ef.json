            "description": "Netty, an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework, has a vulnerability starting in version 4.1.91.Final and prior to version 4.1.118.Final. When a special crafted packet is received via SslHandler it doesn't correctly handle validation of such a packet in all cases which can lead to a native crash. Version 4.1.118.Final contains a patch. As workaround its possible to either disable the usage of the native SSLEngine or change the code manually.",
