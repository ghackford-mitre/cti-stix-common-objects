            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: Fix UAF in __close_file_table_ids\n\nA use-after-free is possible if one thread destroys the file\nvia __ksmbd_close_fd while another thread holds a reference to\nit. The existing checks on fp->refcount are not sufficient to\nprevent this.\n\nThe fix takes ft->lock around the section which removes the\nfile from the file table. This prevents two threads acquiring the\nsame file pointer via __close_file_table_ids, as well as the other\nfunctions which retrieve a file from the IDR and which already use\nthis same lock.",
