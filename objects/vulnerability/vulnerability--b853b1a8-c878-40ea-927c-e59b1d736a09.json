            "description": "The WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to HTML Injection in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly neutralizing HTML elements from submitted order forms. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary HTML that will render when the administrator views order form submissions.",
