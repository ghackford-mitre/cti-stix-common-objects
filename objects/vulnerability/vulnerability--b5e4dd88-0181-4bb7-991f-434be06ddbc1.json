            "description": "The Advanced iFrame plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'advanced_iframe' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2024.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes through the 'src' attribute when the src supplied returns a header with an injected value . This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
