            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: SVM: fix missing sev_decommission in sev_receive_start\n\nDECOMMISSION the current SEV context if binding an ASID fails after\nRECEIVE_START.  Per AMD's SEV API, RECEIVE_START generates a new guest\ncontext and thus needs to be paired with DECOMMISSION:\n\n     The RECEIVE_START command is the only command other than the LAUNCH_START\n     command that generates a new guest context and guest handle.\n\nThe missing DECOMMISSION can result in subsequent SEV launch failures,\nas the firmware leaks memory and might not able to allocate more SEV\nguest contexts in the future.\n\nNote, LAUNCH_START suffered the same bug, but was previously fixed by\ncommit 934002cd660b (\"KVM: SVM: Call SEV Guest Decommission if ASID\nbinding fails\").",
