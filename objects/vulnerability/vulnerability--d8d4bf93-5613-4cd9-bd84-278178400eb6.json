            "description": "The PowerPack Addons for Elementor (Free Widgets, Extensions and Templates) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘pp_animated_gradient_bg_color’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.19 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
