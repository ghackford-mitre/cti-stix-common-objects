            "description": "An issue was discovered in MSA Safety FieldServer Gateways and Embedded Modules with build revisions before 7.0.0. The FieldServer Gateway has internal users, whose access is supposed to be restricted to login locally on the device. However, an attacker can bypass the check for this, which might allow them to authenticate with an internal user account from the network (if they know their password).",
