            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/page_alloc: don't call pfn_to_page() on possibly non-existent PFN in split_large_buddy()\n\nIn split_large_buddy(), we might call pfn_to_page() on a PFN that might\nnot exist.  In corner cases, such as when freeing the highest pageblock in\nthe last memory section, this could result with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM &&\n!CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME in __pfn_to_section() returning NULL and and\n__section_mem_map_addr() dereferencing that NULL pointer.\n\nLet's fix it, and avoid doing a pfn_to_page() call for the first\niteration, where we already have the page.\n\nSo far this was found by code inspection, but let's just CC stable as the\nfix is easy.",
