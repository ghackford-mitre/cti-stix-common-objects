            "description": "The Automate Hub Free by Sperse.IO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'automate_hub' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update an activation status via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
