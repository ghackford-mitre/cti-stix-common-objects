This vulnerability is due to insufficient protections for the web UI of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user, such as deleting users from the device.",
