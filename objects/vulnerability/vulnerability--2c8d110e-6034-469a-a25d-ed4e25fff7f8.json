            "description": "The FileOrganizer â€“ Manage WordPress and Website Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via svg file upload in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. For the free version, this is limited to administrators. The pro version is also vulnerable and exploitable by administrators, but also offers the functionality to lower level users (as low as subscribers) if enabled.",
