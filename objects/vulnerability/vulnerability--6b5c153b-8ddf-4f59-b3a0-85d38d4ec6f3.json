This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to register with the 'wcfm_vendor' role, which is a Store Vendor role in the WCFM Marketplace – Multivendor Marketplace for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress. The vulnerability can only be exploited if the WCFM Marketplace – Multivendor Marketplace for WooCommerce plugin is installed and activated. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.17.3.",
