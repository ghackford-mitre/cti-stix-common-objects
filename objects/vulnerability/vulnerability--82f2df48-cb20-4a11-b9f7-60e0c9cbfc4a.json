            "description": "The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'reset_settings' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the theme's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
