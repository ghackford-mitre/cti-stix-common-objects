            "description": "Due to DLL injection vulnerability in SAPSetup, an attacker with either local user privileges or with access to a compromised corporate userï¿½s Windows account could gain higher privileges. With this, he could move laterally within the network and further compromise the active directory of a company. This leads to high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Windows server.",
