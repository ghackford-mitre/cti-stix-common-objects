            "description": "A vulnerability was found in Samba where a delegated administrator with permission to create objects in Active Directory can write to all attributes of the newly created object, including security-sensitive attributes, even after the object's creation. This issue occurs because the administrator owns the object due to the lack of an Access Control List (ACL) at the time of creation and later being recognized as the 'creator owner.' The retained significant rights of the delegated administrator may not be well understood, potentially leading to unintended privilege escalation or security risks.",
