            "description": "The Essential Addons for Elementor Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Counter widget in all versions up to, and including, 5.8.11 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as 'title_html_tag'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
