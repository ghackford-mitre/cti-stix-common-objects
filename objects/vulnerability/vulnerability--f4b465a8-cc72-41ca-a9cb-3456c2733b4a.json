            "description": "Insecure handling of GET header parameter file included in requests being sent to an instance of the open-source project Phoniebox allows an attacker to create a website, which – when visited by a user – will send malicious requests to multiple hosts on the local network. If such a request reaches the server, it will cause one of the following (depending on the chosen payload): shell command execution, reflected XSS or cross-site request forgery.\n\n\nThis issue affects Phoniebox in all releases through 2.7. Newer releases were not tested, but they might also be vulnerable.",
