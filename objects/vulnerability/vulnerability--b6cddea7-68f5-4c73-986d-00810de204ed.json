            "description": "The Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag & Drop WP Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘description’ and 'btn_txt' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.19 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers with the Form Manager permissions and Subscriber+ user role, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
