            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: accel: mma8452: use the correct logic to get mma8452_data\n\nThe original logic to get mma8452_data is wrong, the *dev point to\nthe device belong to iio_dev. we can't use this dev to find the\ncorrect i2c_client. The original logic happen to work because it\nfinally use dev->driver_data to get iio_dev. Here use the API\nto_i2c_client() is wrong and make reader confuse. To correct the\nlogic, it should be like this\n\n  struct mma8452_data *data = iio_priv(dev_get_drvdata(dev));\n\nBut after commit 8b7651f25962 (\"iio: iio_device_alloc(): Remove\nunnecessary self drvdata\"), the upper logic also can't work.\nWhen try to show the avialable scale in userspace, will meet kernel\ndump, kernel handle NULL pointer dereference.\n\nSo use dev_to_iio_dev() to correct the logic.\n\nDual fixes tags as the second reflects when the bug was exposed, whilst\nthe first reflects when the original bug was introduced.",
