            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nleds: trigger: Unregister sysfs attributes before calling deactivate()\n\nTriggers which have trigger specific sysfs attributes typically store\nrelated data in trigger-data allocated by the activate() callback and\nfreed by the deactivate() callback.\n\nCalling device_remove_groups() after calling deactivate() leaves a window\nwhere the sysfs attributes show/store functions could be called after\ndeactivation and then operate on the just freed trigger-data.\n\nMove the device_remove_groups() call to before deactivate() to close\nthis race window.\n\nThis also makes the deactivation path properly do things in reverse order\nof the activation path which calls the activate() callback before calling\ndevice_add_groups().",
