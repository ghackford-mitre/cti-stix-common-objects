            "description": "The PeproDev Ultimate Profile Solutions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions 1.9.1 to 7.5.2. This is due to handel_ajax_req() function not having proper restrictions on the change_user_meta functionality that makes it possible to set a OTP code and subsequently log in with that OTP code. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to login as other users on the site, including administrators.",
