            "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco AppDynamics Network Visibility Agent could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to the inability to handle unexpected input. An attacker who has local device access could exploit this vulnerability by sending an HTTP request to the targeted service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition by stopping the Network Agent Service on the local device.",
