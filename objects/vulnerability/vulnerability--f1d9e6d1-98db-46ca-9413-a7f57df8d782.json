            "description": "An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 9.0 and 10.0 and 10.1. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Classic Web Client due to insufficient sanitization of HTML content in ICS files. When a user views an e-mail message containing a malicious ICS entry, its embedded JavaScript executes via an ontoggle event inside a <details> tag. This allows an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript within the victim's session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as setting e-mail filters to redirect messages to an attacker-controlled address. As a result, an attacker can perform unauthorized actions on the victim's account, including e-mail redirection and data exfiltration.",
