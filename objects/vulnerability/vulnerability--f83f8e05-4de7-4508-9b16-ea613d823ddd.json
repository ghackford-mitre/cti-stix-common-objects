            "description": "The Survey Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘ays_sections[5][questions][8][title]’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.3.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
