            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: cachestat: fix folio read-after-free in cache walk\n\nIn cachestat, we access the folio from the page cache's xarray to compute\nits page offset, and check for its dirty and writeback flags.  However, we\ndo not hold a reference to the folio before performing these actions,\nwhich means the folio can concurrently be released and reused as another\nfolio/page/slab.\n\nGet around this altogether by just using xarray's existing machinery for\nthe folio page offsets and dirty/writeback states.\n\nThis changes behavior for tmpfs files to now always report zeroes in their\ndirty and writeback counters.  This is okay as tmpfs doesn't follow\nconventional writeback cache behavior: its pages get \"cleaned\" during\nswapout, after which they're no longer resident etc.",
