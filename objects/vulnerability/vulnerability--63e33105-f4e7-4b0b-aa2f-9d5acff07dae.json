            "description": "Triangle MicroWorks SCADA Data Gateway Event Log Improper Output Neutralization For Logs Arbitrary File Write Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to write arbitrary files on affected installations of Triangle MicroWorks SCADA Data Gateway. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of event logs. The issue results from improper sanitization of log output. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20535.",
