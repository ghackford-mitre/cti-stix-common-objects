            "description": "The Themesflat Addons For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several widgets like 'TF E Slider Widget', 'TF Video Widget', 'TF Team Widget' and more in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on URL attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
