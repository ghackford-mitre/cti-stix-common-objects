            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfs: Fix ceph copy to cache on write-begin\n\nAt the end of netfs_unlock_read_folio() in which folios are marked\nappropriately for copying to the cache (either with by being marked dirty\nand having their private data set or by having PG_private_2 set) and then\nunlocked, the folio_queue struct has the entry pointing to the folio\ncleared.  This presents a problem for netfs_pgpriv2_write_to_the_cache(),\nwhich is used to write folios marked with PG_private_2 to the cache as it\nexpects to be able to trawl the folio_queue list thereafter to find the\nrelevant folios, leading to a hang.\n\nFix this by not clearing the folio_queue entry if we're going to do the\ndeprecated copy-to-cache.  The clearance will be done instead as the folios\nare written to the cache.\n\nThis can be reproduced by starting cachefiles, mounting a ceph filesystem\nwith \"-o fsc\" and writing to it.",
