            "description": "A vulnerability in the REST API endpoints of Cisco NDFC could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to read or write files on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because of missing authorization controls on some REST API endpoints. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform limited network-admin functions such as reading device configuration information, uploading files, and modifying uploaded files.\r\nNote: This vulnerability only affects a subset of REST API endpoints and does not affect the web-based management interface.",
