            "description": "Fedify is a TypeScript library for building federated server apps powered by ActivityPub and other standards. This vulnerability allows a user to maneuver the Webfinger mechanism to perform a GET request to any internal resource on any Host, Port, URL combination regardless of present security mechanisms, and forcing the victimâ€™s server into an infinite loop causing Denial of Service. Moreover, this issue can also be maneuvered into performing a Blind SSRF attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.14, 1.1.11, 1.2.11, and 1.3.4.",
