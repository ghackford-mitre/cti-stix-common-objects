            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: rt5645: Fix errorenous cleanup order\n\nThere is a logic error when removing rt5645 device as the function\nrt5645_i2c_remove() first cancel the &rt5645->jack_detect_work and\ndelete the &rt5645->btn_check_timer latter. However, since the timer\nhandler rt5645_btn_check_callback() will re-queue the jack_detect_work,\nthis cleanup order is buggy.\n\nThat is, once the del_timer_sync in rt5645_i2c_remove is concurrently\nrun with the rt5645_btn_check_callback, the canceled jack_detect_work\nwill be rescheduled again, leading to possible use-after-free.\n\nThis patch fix the issue by placing the del_timer_sync function before\nthe cancel_delayed_work_sync.",
