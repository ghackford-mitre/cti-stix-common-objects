            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmb: client: Avoid race in open_cached_dir with lease breaks\n\nA pre-existing valid cfid returned from find_or_create_cached_dir might\nrace with a lease break, meaning open_cached_dir doesn't consider it\nvalid, and thinks it's newly-constructed. This leaks a dentry reference\nif the allocation occurs before the queued lease break work runs.\n\nAvoid the race by extending holding the cfid_list_lock across\nfind_or_create_cached_dir and when the result is checked.",
