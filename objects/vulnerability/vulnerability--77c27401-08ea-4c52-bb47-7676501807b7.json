Prior to version 1.8.180, insufficient input validation during user creation has resulted in a mass assignment vulnerability, allowing an attacker to manipulate all fields of the object, which are enumerated in the $fillable array (the User object), when creating a new user. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.180.",
