            "description": "The WPZOOM Portfolio Lite – Filterable Portfolio Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘align’ attribute within the 'wp:wpzoom-blocks' Gutenberg block in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
