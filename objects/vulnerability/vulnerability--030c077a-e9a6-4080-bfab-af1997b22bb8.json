            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvfio/fsl-mc: Block calling interrupt handler without trigger\n\nThe eventfd_ctx trigger pointer of the vfio_fsl_mc_irq object is\ninitially NULL and may become NULL if the user sets the trigger\neventfd to -1.  The interrupt handler itself is guaranteed that\ntrigger is always valid between request_irq() and free_irq(), but\nthe loopback testing mechanisms to invoke the handler function\nneed to test the trigger.  The triggering and setting ioctl paths\nboth make use of igate and are therefore mutually exclusive.\n\nThe vfio-fsl-mc driver does not make use of irqfds, nor does it\nsupport any sort of masking operations, therefore unlike vfio-pci\nand vfio-platform, the flow can remain essentially unchanged.",
