            "description": "The IntelliSpace portal application utilizes .NET Remoting for its functionality. The vulnerability arises from the exploitation of port 755 through the deserialization vulnerability. After analyzing the configuration files, we observed that the server had set the TypeFilterLevel to Full which is dangerous as it can potentially lead to remote code execution using deserialization. This issue affects IntelliSpace Portal: 12 and prior.",
