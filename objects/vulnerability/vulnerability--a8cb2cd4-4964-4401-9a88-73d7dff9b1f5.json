            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()\n\nSyzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzing\ntest for nilfs2.\n\nThe root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), which\nsearches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory\npage/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.\n\nIf the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory\ninode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but\nfails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled,\nnilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.\n\nFix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a\npage/folio fails in nilfs_find_entry().\n\nThe current interface of nilfs_find_entry() and its callers is outdated\nand cannot propagate error codes such as -EIO and -ENOMEM returned via\nnilfs_find_entry(), so fix it together.",
