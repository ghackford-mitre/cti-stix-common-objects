            "description": "oxyno-zeta/s3-proxy is an aws s3 proxy written in go. In affected versions a Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability enables attackers to create malicious URLs that, when visited, inject scripts into the web application. This can lead to session hijacking or phishing attacks on a trusted domain, posing a moderate risk to all users. It's possible to inject html elements, including scripts through the folder-list template. The affected template allows users to interact with the URL path provided by the `Request.URL.Path` variable, which is then rendered directly into the HTML without proper sanitization or escaping. This can be abused by attackers who craft a malicious URL containing injected HTML or JavaScript. When users visit such a URL, the malicious script will be executed in the user's context. This issue has been addressed in version 4.18.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
