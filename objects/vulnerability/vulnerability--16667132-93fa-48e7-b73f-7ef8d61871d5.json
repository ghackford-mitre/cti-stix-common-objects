            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrivers: staging: rtl8723bs: Fix deadlock in rtw_surveydone_event_callback()\n\nThere is a deadlock in rtw_surveydone_event_callback(),\nwhich is shown below:\n\n   (Thread 1)                  |      (Thread 2)\n                               | _set_timer()\nrtw_surveydone_event_callback()|  mod_timer()\n spin_lock_bh() //(1)          |  (wait a time)\n ...                           | rtw_scan_timeout_handler()\n del_timer_sync()              |  spin_lock_bh() //(2)\n (wait timer to stop)          |  ...\n\nWe hold pmlmepriv->lock in position (1) of thread 1 and use\ndel_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler\nalso need pmlmepriv->lock in position (2) of thread 2.\nAs a result, rtw_surveydone_event_callback() will block forever.\n\nThis patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of\nspin_lock_bh(), which could let timer handler to obtain\nthe needed lock. What`s more, we change spin_lock_bh() in\nrtw_scan_timeout_handler() to spin_lock_irq(). Otherwise,\nspin_lock_bh() will also cause deadlock() in timer handler.",
