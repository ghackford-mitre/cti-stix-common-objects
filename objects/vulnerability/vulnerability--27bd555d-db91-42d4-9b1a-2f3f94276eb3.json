This code is then executed in the victim's browser each time the vulnerable page is visited by the victim. On successful exploitation, an attacker could cause limited impact on confidentiality and integrity within the scope of victimï¿½s browser. There is no impact on availability. This vulnerability occurs only when script/html execution is enabled by the administrator in Central Management Console.",
