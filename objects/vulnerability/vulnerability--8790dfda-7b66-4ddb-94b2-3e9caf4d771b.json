            "description": "Netwrix CoSoSys Endpoint Protector through 5.9.3 and CoSoSys Unify through 7.0.6 contain a remote code execution vulnerability in the application configuration component of the Endpoint Protector and Unify agent which allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to manipulate the configuration of either their own or another client endpoint resulting in the bypass of certain configuration options. Manipulation of the application configuration can result in local policy bypass and in some scenarios remote code execution.",
