            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm: Avoid NULL dereference in msm_disp_state_print_regs()\n\nIf the allocation in msm_disp_state_dump_regs() failed then\n`block->state` can be NULL. The msm_disp_state_print_regs() function\n_does_ have code to try to handle it with:\n\n  if (*reg)\n    dump_addr = *reg;\n\n...but since \"dump_addr\" is initialized to NULL the above is actually\na noop. The code then goes on to dereference `dump_addr`.\n\nMake the function print \"Registers not stored\" when it sees a NULL to\nsolve this. Since we're touching the code, fix\nmsm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take a double-pointer\nand properly mark the pointer as `const`.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/619657/",
