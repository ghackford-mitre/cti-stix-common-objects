            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware: qcom: scm: Cleanup global '__scm' on probe failures\n\nIf SCM driver fails the probe, it should not leave global '__scm'\nvariable assigned, because external users of this driver will assume the\nprobe finished successfully.  For example TZMEM parts ('__scm->mempool')\nare initialized later in the probe, but users of it (__scm_smc_call())\nrely on the '__scm' variable.\n\nThis fixes theoretical NULL pointer exception, triggered via introducing\nprobe deferral in SCM driver with call trace:\n\n  qcom_tzmem_alloc+0x70/0x1ac (P)\n  qcom_tzmem_alloc+0x64/0x1ac (L)\n  qcom_scm_assign_mem+0x78/0x194\n  qcom_rmtfs_mem_probe+0x2d4/0x38c\n  platform_probe+0x68/0xc8",
