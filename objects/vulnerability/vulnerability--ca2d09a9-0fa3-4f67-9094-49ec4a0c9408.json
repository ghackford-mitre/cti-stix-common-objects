            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: fix null-ptr-deref when journal load failed.\n\nDuring the mounting process, if journal_reset() fails because of too short\njournal, then lead to jbd2_journal_load() fails with NULL j_sb_buffer. \nSubsequently, ocfs2_journal_shutdown() calls\njbd2_journal_flush()->jbd2_cleanup_journal_tail()->\n__jbd2_update_log_tail()->jbd2_journal_update_sb_log_tail()\n->lock_buffer(journal->j_sb_buffer), resulting in a null-pointer\ndereference error.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we should check the JBD2_LOADED flag to ensure the\njournal was properly loaded.  Additionally, use journal instead of\nosb->journal directly to simplify the code.",
