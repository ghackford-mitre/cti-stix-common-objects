            "description": "The ProfileGrid â€“ User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the pm_remove_file_attachment() function in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.3.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary user meta which can do things like deny an administrator's access to their site. .",
