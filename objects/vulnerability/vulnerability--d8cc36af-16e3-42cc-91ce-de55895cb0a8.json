            "description": "The Zita Elementor Site Library plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the import_xml_data, xml_data_import, import_option_data, import_widgets, and import_customizer_settings functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to create pages, update certain options, including WooCommerce page titles and Elementor settings, import widgets, and update the plugin's customizer settings and the WordPress custom CSS. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in version 1.6.2.",
