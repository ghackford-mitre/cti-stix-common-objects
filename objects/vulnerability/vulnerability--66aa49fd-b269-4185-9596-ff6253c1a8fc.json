            "description": "The Element Pack Elementor Addons (Header Footer, Template Library, Dynamic Grid & Carousel, Remote Arrows) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file reads in all versions up to, and including, 5.7.2 via the SVG widget and a lack of sufficient file validation in the render_svg function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.",
