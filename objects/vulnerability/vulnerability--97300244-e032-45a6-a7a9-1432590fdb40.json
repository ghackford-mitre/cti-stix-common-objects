            "description": "In KioWare for Windows (versions all through 8.34) it is possible to exit this software and use other already opened applications utilizing a short time window before the forced automatic logout occurs. Then, by using some built-in function of these applications, one may launch any other programs. \nIn order to exploit this vulnerability external applications must be left running when the KioWare software is launched. Additionally, an attacker must know the PIN set for this Kioware instance and also slow down the application with some specific task which extends the usable time window.\n\n",
