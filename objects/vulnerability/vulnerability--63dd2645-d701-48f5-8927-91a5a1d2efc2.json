            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack by exploiting an RFI vulnerability. \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for specific HTTP requests that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive information on the affected device.",
