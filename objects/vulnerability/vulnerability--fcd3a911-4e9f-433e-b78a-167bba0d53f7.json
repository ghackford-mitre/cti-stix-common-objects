The manipulation leads to untrusted search path. The attack needs to be approached locally. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The vendor disagrees that this issue is \"something worth reporting, as every attack surface requires privileged access/user compromise\".",
