            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: fastrpc: avoid double fput() on failed usercopy\n\nIf the copy back to userland fails for the FASTRPC_IOCTL_ALLOC_DMA_BUFF\nioctl(), we shouldn't assume that 'buf->dmabuf' is still valid. In fact,\ndma_buf_fd() called fd_install() before, i.e. \"consumed\" one reference,\nleaving us with none.\n\nCalling dma_buf_put() will therefore put a reference we no longer own,\nleading to a valid file descritor table entry for an already released\n'file' object which is a straight use-after-free.\n\nSimply avoid calling dma_buf_put() and rely on the process exit code to\ndo the necessary cleanup, if needed, i.e. if the file descriptor is\nstill valid.",
