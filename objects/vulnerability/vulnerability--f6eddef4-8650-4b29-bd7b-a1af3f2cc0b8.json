            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnommu: pass NULL argument to vma_iter_prealloc()\n\nWhen deleting a vma entry from a maple tree, it has to pass NULL to\nvma_iter_prealloc() in order to calculate internal state of the tree, but\nit passed a wrong argument.  As a result, nommu kernels crashed upon\naccessing a vma iterator, such as acct_collect() reading the size of vma\nentries after do_munmap().\n\nThis commit fixes this issue by passing a right argument to the\npreallocation call.",
