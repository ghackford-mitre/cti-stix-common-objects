            "description": "The WP Foodbakery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.7. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to setting the current user and their authentication cookie. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain access to a target user's (e.g. administrators) account.",
