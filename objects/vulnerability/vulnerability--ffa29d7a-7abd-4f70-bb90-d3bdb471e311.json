            "description": "Embedded content references at tasks could be used to temporarily execute script code in the context of the users browser session. To exploit this an attacker would require temporary access to the users account, access to another account within the same context or an successful social engineering attack to make users import external content. Attackers could perform malicious API requests or extract information from the users account. Please deploy the provided updates and patch releases. Sanitization of user-generated content has been improved. No publicly available exploits are known.",
