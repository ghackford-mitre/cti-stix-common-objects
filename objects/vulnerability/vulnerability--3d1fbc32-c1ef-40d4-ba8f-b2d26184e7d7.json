            "description": "pnpm is a package manager. Prior to version 10.0.0, the path shortening function uses the md5 function as a path shortening compression function, and if a collision occurs, it will result in the same storage path for two different libraries. Although the real names are under the package name /node_modoules/, there are no version numbers for the libraries they refer to. This issue has been patched in version 10.0.0.",
