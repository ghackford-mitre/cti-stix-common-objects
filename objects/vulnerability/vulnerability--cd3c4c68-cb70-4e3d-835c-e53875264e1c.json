            "description": "An issue was discovered in Siime Eye 14.1.00000001.3.330.0.0.3.14. It uses a default SSID value, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover the physical locations of many Siime Eye devices, violating the privacy of users who do not wish to disclose their ownership of this type of device. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)",
