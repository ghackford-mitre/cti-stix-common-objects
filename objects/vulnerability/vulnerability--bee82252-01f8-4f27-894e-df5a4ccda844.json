Starting in version 4.9.0 and prior to versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4, when checking for broken links on protected pages, Contao sends the cookie header to external urls as well, the passed  options for the http client are used for all requests. Contao versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable crawling protected pages.",
