But of course it's valid that\nthe compiler keeps it at the place where the code puts it which rightfully\ntriggers:\n\n  BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code:\n       caller is hotplug_cpu__broadcast_tick_pull+0x1c/0xc0\n\nMove it to the actual usage site which is in a non-preemptible region.",
