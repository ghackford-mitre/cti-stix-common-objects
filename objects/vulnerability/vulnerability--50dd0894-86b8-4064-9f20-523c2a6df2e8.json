            "description": "Langroid is a Python framework to build large language model (LLM)-powered applications. Prior to version 0.53.15, `LanceDocChatAgent` uses pandas eval() through `compute_from_docs()`. As a result, an attacker may be able to make the agent run malicious commands through `QueryPlan.dataframe_calc]`) compromising the host system. Langroid 0.53.15 sanitizes input to the affected function by default to tackle the most common attack vectors, and added several warnings about the risky behavior in the project documentation.",
