            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: Fix null dereference on suspend\n\nA race condition exists where a synchronous (noqueue) transfer can be\nactive during a system suspend. This can cause a null pointer\ndereference exception to occur when the system resumes.\n\nExample order of events leading to the exception:\n1. spi_sync() calls __spi_transfer_message_noqueue() which sets\n   ctlr->cur_msg\n2. Spi transfer begins via spi_transfer_one_message()\n3. System is suspended interrupting the transfer context\n4. System is resumed\n6. spi_controller_resume() calls spi_start_queue() which resets cur_msg\n   to NULL\n7. Spi transfer context resumes and spi_finalize_current_message() is\n   called which dereferences cur_msg (which is now NULL)\n\nWait for synchronous transfers to complete before suspending by\nacquiring the bus mutex and setting/checking a suspend flag.",
