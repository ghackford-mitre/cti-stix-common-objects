            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: Fix DMA mappings leak\n\nFix leak, when user changes ring parameters.\nDuring reallocation of RX buffers, new DMA mappings are created for\nthose buffers. New buffers with different RX ring count should\nsubstitute older ones, but those buffers were freed in ice_vsi_cfg_rxq\nand reallocated again with ice_alloc_rx_buf. kfree on rx_buf caused\nleak of already mapped DMA.\nReallocate ZC with xdp_buf struct, when BPF program loads. Reallocate\nback to rx_buf, when BPF program unloads.\nIf BPF program is loaded/unloaded and XSK pools are created, reallocate\nRX queues accordingly in XDP_SETUP_XSK_POOL handler.\n\nSteps for reproduction:\nwhile :\ndo\n\tfor ((i=0; i<=8160; i=i+32))\n\tdo\n\t\tethtool -G enp130s0f0 rx $i tx $i\n\t\tsleep 0.5\n\t\tethtool -g enp130s0f0\n\tdone\ndone",
