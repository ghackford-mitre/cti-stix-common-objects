            "description": "Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Limited File Upload in various versions. This is due to a lack of proper checks to ensure lower-privileged roles cannot upload .css and .js files to arbitrary directories. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an administrator, to upload .css and .js files to any directory within the WordPress root directory, which could lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting. The Advanced File Manager Shortcodes plugin must be installed to exploit this vulnerability.",
