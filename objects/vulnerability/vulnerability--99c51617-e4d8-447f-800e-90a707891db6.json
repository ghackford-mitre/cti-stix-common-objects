            "description": "A vulnerability in the RADIUS message processing feature of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain RADIUS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific authentication request to a network access device (NAD) that uses Cisco ISE for authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause Cisco ISE to reload.",
