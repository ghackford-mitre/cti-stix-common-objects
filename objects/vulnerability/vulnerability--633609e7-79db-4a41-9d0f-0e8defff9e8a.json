            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: nl80211: reject cooked mode if it is set along with other flags\n\nIt is possible to set both MONITOR_FLAG_COOK_FRAMES and MONITOR_FLAG_ACTIVE\nflags simultaneously on the same monitor interface from the userspace. This\ncauses a sub-interface to be created with no IEEE80211_SDATA_IN_DRIVER bit\nset because the monitor interface is in the cooked state and it takes\nprecedence over all other states. When the interface is then being deleted\nthe kernel calls WARN_ONCE() from check_sdata_in_driver() because of missing\nthat bit.\n\nFix this by rejecting MONITOR_FLAG_COOK_FRAMES if it is set along with\nother flags.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
