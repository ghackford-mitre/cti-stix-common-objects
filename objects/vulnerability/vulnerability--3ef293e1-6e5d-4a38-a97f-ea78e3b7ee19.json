            "description": "The InWave Jobs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via password reset in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.1. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.",
