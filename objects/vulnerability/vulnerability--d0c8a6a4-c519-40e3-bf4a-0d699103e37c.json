            "description": "The AR for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized double extension file upload due to a missing capability check on the set_ar_featured_image() function in all versions up to, and including, 7.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload php files leveraging a double extension attack. It's important to note the file is deleted immediately and double extension attacks only work on select servers making this unlikely to be successfully exploited.",
