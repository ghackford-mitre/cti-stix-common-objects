            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nSUNRPC: lock against ->sock changing during sysfs read\n\n->sock can be set to NULL asynchronously unless ->recv_mutex is held.\nSo it is important to hold that mutex.  Otherwise a sysfs read can\ntrigger an oops.\nCommit 17f09d3f619a (\"SUNRPC: Check if the xprt is connected before\nhandling sysfs reads\") appears to attempt to fix this problem, but it\nonly narrows the race window.",
