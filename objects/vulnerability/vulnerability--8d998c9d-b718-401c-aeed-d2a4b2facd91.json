            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntee: amdtee: fix race condition in amdtee_open_session\n\nThere is a potential race condition in amdtee_open_session that may\nlead to use-after-free. For instance, in amdtee_open_session() after\nsess->sess_mask is set, and before setting:\n\n    sess->session_info[i] = session_info;\n\nif amdtee_close_session() closes this same session, then 'sess' data\nstructure will be released, causing kernel panic when 'sess' is\naccessed within amdtee_open_session().\n\nThe solution is to set the bit sess->sess_mask as the last step in\namdtee_open_session().",
