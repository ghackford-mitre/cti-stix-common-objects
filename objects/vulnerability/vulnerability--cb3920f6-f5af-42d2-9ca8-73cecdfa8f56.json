            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nEDAC/qcom: Do not pass llcc_driv_data as edac_device_ctl_info's pvt_info\n\nThe memory for llcc_driv_data is allocated by the LLCC driver. But when\nit is passed as the private driver info to the EDAC core, it will get freed\nduring the qcom_edac driver release. So when the qcom_edac driver gets probed\nagain, it will try to use the freed data leading to the use-after-free bug.\n\nHence, do not pass llcc_driv_data as pvt_info but rather reference it\nusing the platform_data pointer in the qcom_edac driver.",
