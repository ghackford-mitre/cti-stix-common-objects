            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsoc: fsl: qbman: Use raw spinlock for cgr_lock\n\nsmp_call_function always runs its callback in hard IRQ context, even on\nPREEMPT_RT, where spinlocks can sleep. So we need to use a raw spinlock\nfor cgr_lock to ensure we aren't waiting on a sleeping task.\n\nAlthough this bug has existed for a while, it was not apparent until\ncommit ef2a8d5478b9 (\"net: dpaa: Adjust queue depth on rate change\")\nwhich invokes smp_call_function_single via qman_update_cgr_safe every\ntime a link goes up or down.",
