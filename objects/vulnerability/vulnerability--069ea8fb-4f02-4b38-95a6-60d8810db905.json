            "description": "The SimpleShop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the maybe_disconnect_simpleshop function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disconnect the site from simpleshop via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
