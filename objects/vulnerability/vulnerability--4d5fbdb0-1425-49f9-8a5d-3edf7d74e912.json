            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: mcp251xfd: fix infinite loop when xmit fails\n\nWhen the mcp251xfd_start_xmit() function fails, the driver stops\nprocessing messages, and the interrupt routine does not return,\nrunning indefinitely even after killing the running application.\n\nError messages:\n[  441.298819] mcp251xfd spi2.0 can0: ERROR in mcp251xfd_start_xmit: -16\n[  441.306498] mcp251xfd spi2.0 can0: Transmit Event FIFO buffer not empty. (seq=0x000017c7, tef_tail=0x000017cf, tef_head=0x000017d0, tx_head=0x000017d3).\n... and repeat forever.\n\nThe issue can be triggered when multiple devices share the same SPI\ninterface. And there is concurrent access to the bus.\n\nThe problem occurs because tx_ring->head increments even if\nmcp251xfd_start_xmit() fails. Consequently, the driver skips one TX\npackage while still expecting a response in\nmcp251xfd_handle_tefif_one().\n\nResolve the issue by starting a workqueue to write the tx obj\nsynchronously if err = -EBUSY. In case of another error, decrement\ntx_ring->head, remove skb from the echo stack, and drop the message.\n\n[mkl: use more imperative wording in patch description]",
