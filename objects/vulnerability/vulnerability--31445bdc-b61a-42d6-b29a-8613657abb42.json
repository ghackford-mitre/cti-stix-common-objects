            "description": "The Gutenberg Blocks and Page Layouts â€“ Attire Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the disable_fe_assets function in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or above, to change the plugin's settings. Additionally, no nonce check is performed resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.",
