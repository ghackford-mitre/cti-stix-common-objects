            "description": "Certificate Validation user interface in LibreOffice allows potential vulnerability.\n\n\n\n\nSigned macros are scripts that have been digitally signed by the \ndeveloper using a cryptographic signature. When a document with a signed\n macro is opened a warning is displayed by LibreOffice before the macro \nis executed.\n\nPreviously if verification failed the user could fail to understand the failure and choose to enable the macros anyway.\n\n\nThis issue affects LibreOffice: from 24.2 before 24.2.5.",
