            "description": "G DATA Total Security GDBackupSvc Service Link Following Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of G Data Total Security. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the GDBackupSvc service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to create a file with a permissive DACL. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-20694.",
