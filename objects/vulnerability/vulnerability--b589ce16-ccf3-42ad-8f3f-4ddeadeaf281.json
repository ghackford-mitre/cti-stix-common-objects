            "description": "The AppPresser â€“ Mobile App Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.4. This is due to the appp_reset_password() and validate_reset_password() functions not having enough controls to prevent a successful brute force attack of the OTP to change a password, or verify that a password reset request came from an authorized user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate and brute force an OTP that makes it possible to change any users passwords, including an administrator.",
