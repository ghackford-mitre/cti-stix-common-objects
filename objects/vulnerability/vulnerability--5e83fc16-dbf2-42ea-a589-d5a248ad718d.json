            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: m_can: m_can_{read_fifo,echo_tx_event}(): shift timestamp to full 32 bits\n\nIn commit 1be37d3b0414 (\"can: m_can: fix periph RX path: use\nrx-offload to ensure skbs are sent from softirq context\") the RX path\nfor peripheral devices was switched to RX-offload.\n\nReceived CAN frames are pushed to RX-offload together with a\ntimestamp. RX-offload is designed to handle overflows of the timestamp\ncorrectly, if 32 bit timestamps are provided.\n\nThe timestamps of m_can core are only 16 bits wide. So this patch\nshifts them to full 32 bit before passing them to RX-offload.",
