            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV042, RV042G, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an authenticated, Administrator-level, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as the root user.",
