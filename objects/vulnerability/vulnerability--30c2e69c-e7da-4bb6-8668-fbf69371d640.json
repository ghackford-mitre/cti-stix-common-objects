            "description": "FOG is a free open-source cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system. There is a security issue with the NFS configuration in /etc/exports generated by the installer that allows an attacker to modify files outside the export in the default installation. The exports have the no_subtree_check option. The no_subtree_check option means that if a client performs a file operation, the server will only check if the requested file is on the correct filesystem, not if it is in the correct directory. This enables modifying files in /images, accessing other files on the same filesystem, and accessing files on other filesystems. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.10.30.",
