            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Affirm IDR0.CCTW on apps_smmu\"\n\nThere are reports that the pagetable walker cache coherency is not a\ngiven across the spectrum of SDM845/850 devices, leading to lock-ups\nand resets. It works fine on some devices (like the Dragonboard 845c,\nbut not so much on the Lenovo Yoga C630).\n\nThis unfortunately looks like a fluke in firmware development, where\nlikely somewhere in the vast hypervisor stack, a change to accommodate\nfor this was only introduced after the initial software release (which\noften serves as a baseline for products).\n\nRevert the change to avoid additional guesswork around crashes.\n\nThis reverts commit 6b31a9744b8726c69bb0af290f8475a368a4b805.",
