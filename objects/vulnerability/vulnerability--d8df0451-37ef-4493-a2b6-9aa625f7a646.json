            "description": "A vulnerability in the API of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload files to arbitrary locations on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Super&nbsp;Admin credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters in API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload custom files to arbitrary locations on the underlying operating system, execute arbitrary code, and elevate privileges to root.",
