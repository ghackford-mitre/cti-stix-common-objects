            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm integrity: fix memory corruption when tag_size is less than digest size\n\nIt is possible to set up dm-integrity in such a way that the\n\"tag_size\" parameter is less than the actual digest size. In this\nsituation, a part of the digest beyond tag_size is ignored.\n\nIn this case, dm-integrity would write beyond the end of the\nic->recalc_tags array and corrupt memory. The corruption happened in\nintegrity_recalc->integrity_sector_checksum->crypto_shash_final.\n\nFix this corruption by increasing the tags array so that it has enough\npadding at the end to accomodate the loop in integrity_recalc() being\nable to write a full digest size for the last member of the tags\narray.",
