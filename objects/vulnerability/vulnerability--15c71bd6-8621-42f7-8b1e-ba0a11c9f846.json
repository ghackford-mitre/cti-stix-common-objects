            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/v3d: Add job to pending list if the reset was skipped\n\nWhen a CL/CSD job times out, we check if the GPU has made any progress\nsince the last timeout. If so, instead of resetting the hardware, we skip\nthe reset and let the timer get rearmed. This gives long-running jobs a\nchance to complete.\n\nHowever, when `timedout_job()` is called, the job in question is removed\nfrom the pending list, which means it won't be automatically freed through\n`free_job()`. Consequently, when we skip the reset and keep the job\nrunning, the job won't be freed when it finally completes.\n\nThis situation leads to a memory leak, as exposed in [1] and [2].\n\nSimilarly to commit 704d3d60fec4 (\"drm/etnaviv: don't block scheduler when\nGPU is still active\"), this patch ensures the job is put back on the\npending list when extending the timeout.",
