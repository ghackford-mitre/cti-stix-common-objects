            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu/gfx9: Add Cleaner Shader Deinitialization in gfx_v9_0 Module\n\nThis commit addresses an omission in the previous patch related to the\ncleaner shader support for GFX9 hardware. Specifically, it adds the\nnecessary deinitialization code for the cleaner shader in the\ngfx_v9_0_sw_fini function.\n\nThe added line amdgpu_gfx_cleaner_shader_sw_fini(adev); ensures that any\nallocated resources for the cleaner shader are freed correctly, avoiding\npotential memory leaks and ensuring that the GPU state is clean for the\nnext initialization sequence.",
