            "description": "Following the recent Chrome sandbox escape (CVE-2025-2783), various Firefox developers identified a similar pattern in our IPC code. A compromised child process could cause the parent process to return an unintentionally powerful handle, leading to a sandbox escape. \nThe original vulnerability was being exploited in the wild. \n*This only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 136.0.4, Firefox ESR < 128.8.1, and Firefox ESR < 115.21.1.",
