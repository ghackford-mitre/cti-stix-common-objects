            "description": "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the 'Servers Configurations' function of the parisneo/lollms-webui, versions 9.6 to the latest. The affected functions include Elastic search Service (under construction), XTTS service, Petals service, vLLM service, and Motion Ctrl service, which lack CSRF protection. This vulnerability allows attackers to deceive users into unwittingly installing the XTTS service among other packages by submitting a malicious installation request. Successful exploitation results in attackers tricking users into performing actions without their consent.",
