            "description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization in model_information.py. `model_name` in model_information.py takes user-supplied input (e.g. a path to a model) and pass that value to the `run_model_information_script` and later to `model_information` function, which loads that model with `torch.load` in rvc/train/process/model_information.py (on line 16 in 3.2.8-bugfix), which is vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. The issue can lead to remote code execution. A patch is available in the `main` branch of the repository.",
