            "description": "A flaw was found in libvirt. A refactor of the code fetching the list of interfaces for multiple APIs introduced a corner case on platforms where allocating 0 bytes of memory results in a NULL pointer. This corner case would lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and subsequent crash of virtinterfaced. This issue could allow clients connecting to the read-only socket to crash the virtinterfaced daemon.",
