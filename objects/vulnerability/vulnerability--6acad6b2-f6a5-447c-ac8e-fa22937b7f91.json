            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: once more fix the call oder in amdgpu_ttm_move() v2\n\nThis reverts drm/amdgpu: fix ftrace event amdgpu_bo_move always move\non same heap. The basic problem here is that after the move the old\nlocation is simply not available any more.\n\nSome fixes were suggested, but essentially we should call the move\nnotification before actually moving things because only this way we have\nthe correct order for DMA-buf and VM move notifications as well.\n\nAlso rework the statistic handling so that we don't update the eviction\ncounter before the move.\n\nv2: add missing NULL check",
