            "description": "SAP Commerce Cloud (Public Cloud) does not allow to disable unencrypted HTTP (port 80) entirely, but instead allows a redirect from port 80 to 443 (HTTPS). As a result, Commerce normally communicates securely over HTTPS. However, the confidentiality and integrity of data sent on the first request before the redirect may be impacted if the client is configured to use HTTP and sends confidential data on the first request before the redirect.",
