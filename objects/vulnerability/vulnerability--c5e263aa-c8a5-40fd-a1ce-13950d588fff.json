            "description": "The Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets, Addons, Templates) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘username’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.112 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above and granted plugin setting edit permissions by an administrator, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
