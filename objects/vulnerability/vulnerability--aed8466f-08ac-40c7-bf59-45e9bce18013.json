            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of buffer delay flag\n\nSyzbot reported that after nilfs2 reads a corrupted file system image\nand degrades to read-only, the BUG_ON check for the buffer delay flag\nin submit_bh_wbc() may fail, causing a kernel bug.\n\nThis is because the buffer delay flag is not cleared when clearing the\nbuffer state flags to discard a page/folio or a buffer head. So, fix\nthis.\n\nThis became necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page clear routine\nwas expanded.  This state inconsistency does not occur if the buffer\nis written normally by log writing.",
