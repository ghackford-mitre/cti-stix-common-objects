            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-pci: fix freeing of the HMB descriptor table\n\nThe HMB descriptor table is sized to the maximum number of descriptors\nthat could be used for a given device, but __nvme_alloc_host_mem could\nbreak out of the loop earlier on memory allocation failure and end up\nusing less descriptors than planned for, which leads to an incorrect\nsize passed to dma_free_coherent.\n\nIn practice this was not showing up because the number of descriptors\ntends to be low and the dma coherent allocator always allocates and\nfrees at least a page.",
