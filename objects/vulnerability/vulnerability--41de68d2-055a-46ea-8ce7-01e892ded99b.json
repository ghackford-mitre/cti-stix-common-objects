            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/pci: Fix duplicate pci_dev_put() in disable_slot() when PF has child VFs\n\nWith commit bcb5d6c76903 (\"s390/pci: introduce lock to synchronize state\nof zpci_dev's\") the code to ignore power off of a PF that has child VFs\nwas changed from a direct return to a goto to the unlock and\npci_dev_put() section. The change however left the existing pci_dev_put()\nuntouched resulting in a doubple put. This can subsequently cause a use\nafter free if the struct pci_dev is released in an unexpected state.\nFix this by removing the extra pci_dev_put().",
