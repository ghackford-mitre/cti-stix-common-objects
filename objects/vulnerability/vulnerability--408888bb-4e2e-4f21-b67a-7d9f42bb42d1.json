            "description": "3CX Uncontrolled Search Path Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of 3CX. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the configuration of OpenSSL. The product loads an OpenSSL configuration file from an unsecured location. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
