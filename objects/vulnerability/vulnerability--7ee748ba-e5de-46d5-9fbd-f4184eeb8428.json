            "description": "The Mercado Pago payments for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in versions 7.3.0 to 7.5.1 via the mercadopagoDownloadLog function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to download and read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information. The arbitrary file download was patched in 7.5.1, while the missing authorization was corrected in version 7.6.2.",
