            "description": "The WP Image Uploader plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the gky_image_uploader_main_function() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
