Improper network isolation between the guest Wi-Fi network and other network interfaces on the router allows an attacker (who is authenticated to the guest Wi-Fi) to access resources on the router and/or resources and devices on other networks hosted by the router by configuring a static IP address (within the non-guest subnet) on their host.",
