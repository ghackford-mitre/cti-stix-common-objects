            "description": "The Mortgage Lead Capture System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 8.2.10. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'wprequal_reset_defaults' action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
