            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nthermal: core: call put_device() only after device_register() fails\n\nput_device() shouldn't be called before a prior call to\ndevice_register(). __thermal_cooling_device_register() doesn't follow\nthat properly and needs fixing. Also\nthermal_cooling_device_destroy_sysfs() is getting called unnecessarily\non few error paths.\n\nFix all this by placing the calls at the right place.\n\nBased on initial work done by Caleb Connolly.",
