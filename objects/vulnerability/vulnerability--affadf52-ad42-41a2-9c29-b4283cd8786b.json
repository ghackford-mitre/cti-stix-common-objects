            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/dp: populate connector of struct dp_panel\n\nDP CTS test case 4.2.2.6 has valid edid with bad checksum on purpose\nand expect DP source return correct checksum. During drm edid read,\ncorrect edid checksum is calculated and stored at\nconnector::real_edid_checksum.\n\nThe problem is struct dp_panel::connector never be assigned, instead the\nconnector is stored in struct msm_dp::connector. When we run compliance\ntesting test case 4.2.2.6 dp_panel_handle_sink_request() won't have a valid\nedid set in struct dp_panel::edid so we'll try to use the connectors\nreal_edid_checksum and hit a NULL pointer dereference error because the\nconnector pointer is never assigned.\n\nChanges in V2:\n-- populate panel connector at msm_dp_modeset_init() instead of at dp_panel_read_sink_caps()\n\nChanges in V3:\n-- remove unhelpful kernel crash trace commit text\n-- remove renaming dp_display parameter to dp\n\nChanges in V4:\n-- add more details to commit text\n\nChanges in v10:\n--  group into one series\n\nChanges in v11:\n-- drop drm/msm/dp: dp_link_parse_sink_count() return immediately if aux read\n\nSignee-off-by: Kuogee Hsieh <quic_khsieh@quicinc.com>",
