            "description": "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the restart_program function of the parisneo/lollms-webui v9.6. This vulnerability allows attackers to trick users into performing unintended actions, such as resetting the program without their knowledge, by sending specially crafted CSRF forms. This issue affects the installation process, including the installation of Binding zoo and Models zoo, by unexpectedly resetting programs. The vulnerability is due to the lack of CSRF protection in the affected function.",
