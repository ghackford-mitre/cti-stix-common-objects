            "description": "Saltcorn is an extensible, open source, no-code database application builder. A logged-in user with any role can delete arbitrary files on the filesystem by calling the `sync/clean_sync_dir` endpoint. The `dir_name` POST parameter is not validated/sanitized and is used to construct the `syncDir` that is deleted by calling `fs.rm`. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.0.0-beta16 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
