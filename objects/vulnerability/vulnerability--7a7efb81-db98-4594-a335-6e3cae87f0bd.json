            "description": "Adobe Framemaker versions 2020.6, 2022.4 and earlier are affected by an Untrusted Search Path vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting a malicious path into the search directories, which the application could unknowingly execute. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction.",
