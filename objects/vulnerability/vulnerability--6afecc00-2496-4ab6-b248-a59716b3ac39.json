It's not a bad way to do it;\nhis patch had some bugs and my patches had some bugs.  Hopefully all our\nbugs were different from each other.  And hopefully Mark likes all the\nchanges I made to his code!\n\n\nThis patch (of 23):\n\nIf we can't read the buffer, be sure to unlock the page before returning.",
