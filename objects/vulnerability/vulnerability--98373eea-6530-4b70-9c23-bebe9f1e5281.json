            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nselinux: fix NULL-pointer dereference when hashtab allocation fails\n\nWhen the hash table slot array allocation fails in hashtab_init(),\nh->size is left initialized with a non-zero value, but the h->htable\npointer is NULL. This may then cause a NULL pointer dereference, since\nthe policydb code relies on the assumption that even after a failed\nhashtab_init(), hashtab_map() and hashtab_destroy() can be safely called\non it. Yet, these detect an empty hashtab only by looking at the size.\n\nFix this by making sure that hashtab_init() always leaves behind a valid\nempty hashtab when the allocation fails.",
