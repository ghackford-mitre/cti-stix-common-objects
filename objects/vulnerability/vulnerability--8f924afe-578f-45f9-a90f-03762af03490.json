            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: smartpqi: Use is_kdump_kernel() to check for kdump\n\nThe smartpqi driver checks the reset_devices variable to determine\nwhether special adjustments need to be made for kdump. This has the\neffect that after a regular kexec reboot, some driver parameters such as\nmax_transfer_size are much lower than usual. More importantly, kexec\nreboot tests have revealed memory corruption caused by the driver log\nbeing written to system memory after a kexec.\n\nFix this by testing is_kdump_kernel() rather than reset_devices where\nappropriate.",
