            "description": "The WP All Import Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.7. This is due to missing nonce validation on the delete_and_edit function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete imported content (posts, comments, users, etc.) via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
