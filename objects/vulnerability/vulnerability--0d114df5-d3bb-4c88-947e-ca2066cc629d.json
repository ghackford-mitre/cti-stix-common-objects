In mesh networks using Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, or WPA3) or Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), an adversary can exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary frames towards devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2020-24588. P802.11-REVme, as of early 2025, is a planned release of the 802.11 standard.",
