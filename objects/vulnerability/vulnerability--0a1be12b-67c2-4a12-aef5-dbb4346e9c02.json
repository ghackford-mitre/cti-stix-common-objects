            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probe\n\np2sb_bar() unhides P2SB device to get resources from the device. It\nguards the operation by locking pci_rescan_remove_lock so that parallel\nrescans do not find the P2SB device. However, this lock causes deadlock\nwhen PCI bus rescan is triggered by /sys/bus/pci/rescan. The rescan\nlocks pci_rescan_remove_lock and probes PCI devices. When PCI devices\ncall p2sb_bar() during probe, it locks pci_rescan_remove_lock again.\nHence the deadlock.\n\nTo avoid the deadlock, do not lock pci_rescan_remove_lock in p2sb_bar().\nInstead, do the lock at fs_initcall. Introduce p2sb_cache_resources()\nfor fs_initcall which gets and caches the P2SB resources. At p2sb_bar(),\nrefer the cache and return to the caller.\n\nBefore operating the device at P2SB DEVFN for resource cache, check\nthat its device class is PCI_CLASS_MEMORY_OTHER 0x0580 that PCH\nspecifications define. This avoids unexpected operation to other devices\nat the same DEVFN.\n\nTested-by Klara Modin <klarasmodin@gmail.com>",
