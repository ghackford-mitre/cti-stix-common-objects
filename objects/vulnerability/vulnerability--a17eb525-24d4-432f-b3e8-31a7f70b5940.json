            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: i801: Don't generate an interrupt on bus reset\n\nNow that the i2c-i801 driver supports interrupts, setting the KILL bit\nin a attempt to recover from a timed out transaction triggers an\ninterrupt. Unfortunately, the interrupt handler (i801_isr) is not\nprepared for this situation and will try to process the interrupt as\nif it was signaling the end of a successful transaction. In the case\nof a block transaction, this can result in an out-of-range memory\naccess.\n\nThis condition was reproduced several times by syzbot:\nhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=ed71512d469895b5b34e\nhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=8c8dedc0ba9e03f6c79e\nhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=c8ff0b6d6c73d81b610e\nhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=33f6c360821c399d69eb\nhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=be15dc0b1933f04b043a\nhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=b4d3fd1dfd53e90afd79\n\nSo disable interrupts while trying to reset the bus. Interrupts will\nbe enabled again for the following transaction.",
