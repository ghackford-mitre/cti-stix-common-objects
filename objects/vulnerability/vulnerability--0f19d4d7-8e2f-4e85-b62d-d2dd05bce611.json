            "description": "An ActiveMQ Discovery service was reachable by default from an OpenEdge Management installation when an OEE/OEM auto-discovery feature was activated.  Unauthorized access to the discovery service's UDP port allowed content injection into parts of the OEM web interface making it possible for other types of attack that could spoof or deceive web interface users.   Unauthorized use of the OEE/OEM discovery service was remediated by deactivating the discovery service by default.",
