            "description": "In h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0.2, a vulnerability exists where uploading and repeatedly parsing a large GZIP file can cause a denial of service. The server becomes unresponsive due to memory exhaustion and a large number of concurrent slow-running jobs. This issue arises from the improper handling of highly compressed data, leading to significant data amplification.",
