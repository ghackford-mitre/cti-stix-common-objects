            "description": "The Puzzles | WP Magazine / Review with Store WordPress Theme + RTL theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to a missing capability check on the 'theme_options_ajax_post_action' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts. The developer opted to remove the software from the repository, so an update is not available and it is recommended to find a replacement software.",
