            "description": "The The Request a Quote for WooCommerce and Elementor – Get a Quote Button – Product Enquiry Form Popup – Product Quotation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via fire_contact_form AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.",
