            "description": "The Build Your Dream Website Fast with 400+ Starter Templates and Landing Pages, No Coding Needed, One-Click Import for Elementor & Gutenberg Blocks! â€“ TemplateSpare plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'templatespare_activate_required_theme' and 'templatespare_get_theme_status' functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to activate any installed theme and read any theme status. If the attacker attempts to activate a theme that is not installed, a non-existent theme with the slug chosen by the attacker will be considered the active theme, leaving the site with no theme functionality.",
