            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: mxl111sf: change mutex_init() location\n\nSyzbot reported, that mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() uses uninitialized\nmutex. The problem was in wrong mutex_init() location.\n\nPrevious mutex_init(&state->msg_lock) call was in ->init() function, but\ndvb_usbv2_init() has this order of calls:\n\n\tdvb_usbv2_init()\n\t  dvb_usbv2_adapter_init()\n\t    dvb_usbv2_adapter_frontend_init()\n\t      props->frontend_attach()\n\n\t  props->init()\n\nSince mxl111sf_* devices call mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() in ->frontend_attach()\ninternally we need to initialize state->msg_lock before\nfrontend_attach(). To achieve it, ->probe() call added to all mxl111sf_*\ndevices, which will simply initiaize mutex.",
