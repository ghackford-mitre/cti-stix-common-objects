            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: idxd: Avoid unnecessary destruction of file_ida\n\nfile_ida is allocated during cdev open and is freed accordingly\nduring cdev release. This sequence is guaranteed by driver file\noperations. Therefore, there is no need to destroy an already empty\nfile_ida when the WQ cdev is removed.\n\nWorse, ida_free() in cdev release may happen after destruction of\nfile_ida per WQ cdev. This can lead to accessing an id in file_ida\nafter it has been destroyed, resulting in a kernel panic.\n\nRemove ida_destroy(&file_ida) to address these issues.",
