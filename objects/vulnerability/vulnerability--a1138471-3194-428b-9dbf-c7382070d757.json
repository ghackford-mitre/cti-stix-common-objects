            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: fix slab-use-after-free due to dangling pointer dqi_priv\n\nWhen mounting ocfs2 and then remounting it as read-only, a\nslab-use-after-free occurs after the user uses a syscall to\nquota_getnextquota.  Specifically, sb_dqinfo(sb, type)->dqi_priv is the\ndangling pointer.\n\nDuring the remounting process, the pointer dqi_priv is freed but is never\nset as null leaving it to be accessed.  Additionally, the read-only option\nfor remounting sets the DQUOT_SUSPENDED flag instead of setting the\nDQUOT_USAGE_ENABLED flags.  Moreover, later in the process of getting the\nnext quota, the function ocfs2_get_next_id is called and only checks the\nquota usage flags and not the quota suspended flags.\n\nTo fix this, I set dqi_priv to null when it is freed after remounting with\nread-only and put a check for DQUOT_SUSPENDED in ocfs2_get_next_id.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: coding-style cleanups]",
