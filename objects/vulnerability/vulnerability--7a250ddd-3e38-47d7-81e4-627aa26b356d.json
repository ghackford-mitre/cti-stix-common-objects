If the timer handler is running, del_timer() could\nnot stop it and will return directly. If the port region is released by\nrelease_region() and then the timer handler cpu5wdt_trigger() calls outb()\nto write into the region that is released, the use-after-free bug will\nhappen.\n\nChange del_timer() to timer_shutdown_sync() in order that the timer handler\ncould be finished before the port region is released.",
