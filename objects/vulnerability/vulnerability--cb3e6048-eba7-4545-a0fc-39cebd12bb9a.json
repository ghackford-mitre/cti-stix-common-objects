            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: rkisp1: Fix IRQ handling due to shared interrupts\n\nThe driver requests the interrupts as IRQF_SHARED, so the interrupt\nhandlers can be called at any time. If such a call happens while the ISP\nis powered down, the SoC will hang as the driver tries to access the\nISP registers.\n\nThis can be reproduced even without the platform sharing the IRQ line:\nEnable CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ and unload the driver, and the board will\nhang.\n\nFix this by adding a new field, 'irqs_enabled', which is used to bail\nout from the interrupt handler when the ISP is not operational.",
