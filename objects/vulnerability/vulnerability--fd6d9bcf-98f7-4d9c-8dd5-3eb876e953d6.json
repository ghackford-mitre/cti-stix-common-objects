            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmmc: sdhci-msm: pervent access to suspended controller\n\nGeneric sdhci code registers LED device and uses host->runtime_suspended\nflag to protect access to it. The sdhci-msm driver doesn't set this flag,\nwhich causes a crash when LED is accessed while controller is runtime\nsuspended. Fix this by setting the flag correctly.",
