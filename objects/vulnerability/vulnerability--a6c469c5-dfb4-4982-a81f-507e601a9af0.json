            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbdev: savage: Error out if pixclock equals zero\n\nThe userspace program could pass any values to the driver through\nioctl() interface. If the driver doesn't check the value of pixclock,\nit may cause divide-by-zero error.\n\nAlthough pixclock is checked in savagefb_decode_var(), but it is not\nchecked properly in savagefb_probe(). Fix this by checking whether\npixclock is zero in the function savagefb_check_var() before\ninfo->var.pixclock is used as the divisor.\n\nThis is similar to CVE-2022-3061 in i740fb which was fixed by\ncommit 15cf0b8.",
