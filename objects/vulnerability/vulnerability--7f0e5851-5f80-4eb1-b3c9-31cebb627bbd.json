            "description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference has been discovered in the id3v2_read_synch_uint function, located in id3v2.c. If id3v2_read_synch_uint is called with a null work->hdr.frame_data, the pointer guint8 *data is accessed without validation, resulting in a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
