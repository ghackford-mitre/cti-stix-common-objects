            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen-netfront: Add missing skb_mark_for_recycle\n\nNotice that skb_mark_for_recycle() is introduced later than fixes tag in\ncommit 6a5bcd84e886 (\"page_pool: Allow drivers to hint on SKB recycling\").\n\nIt is believed that fixes tag were missing a call to page_pool_release_page()\nbetween v5.9 to v5.14, after which is should have used skb_mark_for_recycle().\nSince v6.6 the call page_pool_release_page() were removed (in\ncommit 535b9c61bdef (\"net: page_pool: hide page_pool_release_page()\")\nand remaining callers converted (in commit 6bfef2ec0172 (\"Merge branch\n'net-page_pool-remove-page_pool_release_page'\")).\n\nThis leak became visible in v6.8 via commit dba1b8a7ab68 (\"mm/page_pool: catch\npage_pool memory leaks\").",
