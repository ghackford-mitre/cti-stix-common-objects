Versions up to and including 2.9.8 are vulnerable to denial of service in one special case (in stable released versions): when the payload's content type is `application/json`, and there is at least one rule which does a `sanitiseMatchedBytes` action. A patch is available at pull request 3389 and expected to be part of version 2.9.9. No known workarounds are available.",
