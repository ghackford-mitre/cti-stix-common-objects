            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix racing between bpf_timer_cancel_and_free and bpf_timer_cancel\n\nThe following race is possible between bpf_timer_cancel_and_free\nand bpf_timer_cancel. It will lead a UAF on the timer->timer.\n\nbpf_timer_cancel();\n\tspin_lock();\n\tt = timer->time;\n\tspin_unlock();\n\n\t\t\t\t\tbpf_timer_cancel_and_free();\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspin_lock();\n\t\t\t\t\t\tt = timer->timer;\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttimer->timer = NULL;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspin_unlock();\n\t\t\t\t\t\thrtimer_cancel(&t->timer);\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkfree(t);\n\n\t/* UAF on t */\n\thrtimer_cancel(&t->timer);\n\nIn bpf_timer_cancel_and_free, this patch frees the timer->timer\nafter a rcu grace period. This requires a rcu_head addition\nto the \"struct bpf_hrtimer\". Another kfree(t) happens in bpf_timer_init,\nthis does not need a kfree_rcu because it is still under the\nspin_lock and timer->timer has not been visible by others yet.\n\nIn bpf_timer_cancel, rcu_read_lock() is added because this helper\ncan be used in a non rcu critical section context (e.g. from\na sleepable bpf prog). Other timer->timer usages in helpers.c\nhave been audited, bpf_timer_cancel() is the only place where\ntimer->timer is used outside of the spin_lock.\n\nAnother solution considered is to mark a t->flag in bpf_timer_cancel\nand clear it after hrtimer_cancel() is done.  In bpf_timer_cancel_and_free,\nit busy waits for the flag to be cleared before kfree(t). This patch\ngoes with a straight forward solution and frees timer->timer after\na rcu grace period.",
