            "description": "A vulnerability in the tenant security implementation of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator (NDO) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify or delete tenant templates on an affected system. \r\n \r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper access controls within tenant security. An attacker who is using a valid user account with write privileges and either a Site Manager or Tenant Manager role could exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify or delete tenant templates under non-associated tenants, which could disrupt network traffic.",
