This flaw could allow unauthorized access to sensitive report data.\n\n  *  Improper Authorization:Â An authorization flaw exists in Mautic's API Authorization implementation. Any authenticated user, regardless of assigned roles or permissions, can access all reports and their associated data via the API. This bypasses the intended access controls governed by the \"Reporting Permissions > View Own\" and \"Reporting Permissions > View Others\" permissions, which should restrict access to non-System Reports.",
