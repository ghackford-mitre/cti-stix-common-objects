            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: SHAMPO, Fix incorrect page release\n\nUnder the following conditions:\n1) No skb created yet\n2) header_size == 0 (no SHAMPO header)\n3) header_index + 1 % MLX5E_SHAMPO_WQ_HEADER_PER_PAGE == 0 (this is the\n   last page fragment of a SHAMPO header page)\n\na new skb is formed with a page that is NOT a SHAMPO header page (it\nis a regular data page). Further down in the same function\n(mlx5e_handle_rx_cqe_mpwrq_shampo()), a SHAMPO header page from\nheader_index is released. This is wrong and it leads to SHAMPO header\npages being released more than once.",
