            "description": "netease-youdao/qanything version 1.4.1 contains a vulnerability where unsafe data obtained from user input is concatenated in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection. The affected functions include `get_knowledge_base_name`, `from_status_to_status`, `delete_files`, and `get_file_by_status`. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially stealing information from the database. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.2.",
