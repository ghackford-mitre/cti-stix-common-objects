            "description": "The Post Saint: ChatGPT, GPT4, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Pexels, Dezgo AI Text & Image Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary files uploads due to a missing capability check and file type validation on the add_image_to_library AJAX action function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files that make remote code execution possible.",
