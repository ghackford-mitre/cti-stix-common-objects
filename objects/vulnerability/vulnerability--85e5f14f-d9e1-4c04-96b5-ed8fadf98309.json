            "description": "The ARMember Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.7. This is due to incorrectly implemented nonce validation function on multiple functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify, or delete user meta and plugin options which can lead to limited privilege escalation.",
