            "description": "The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes certain characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers. The inclusion of invalidated data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the full HTTP response represented by the browser. An attacker could control the response and craft attacks such as cross-site scripting and cache poisoning attacks.",
