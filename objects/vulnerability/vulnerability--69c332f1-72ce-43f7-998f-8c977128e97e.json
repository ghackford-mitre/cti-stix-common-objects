            "description": "CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs and data portals. The Datatables view plugin did not properly escape record data coming from the DataStore, leading to a potential XSS vector. Sites running CKAN >= 2.7.0 with the datatables_view plugin activated. This is a plugin included in CKAN core, that not activated by default but it is widely used to preview tabular data. This vulnerability has been fixed in CKAN 2.10.5 and 2.11.0.",
