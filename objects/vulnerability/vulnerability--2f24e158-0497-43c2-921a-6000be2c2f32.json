            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/panthor: Restrict high priorities on group_create\n\nWe were allowing any users to create a high priority group without any\npermission checks. As a result, this was allowing possible denial of\nservice.\n\nWe now only allow the DRM master or users with the CAP_SYS_NICE\ncapability to set higher priorities than PANTHOR_GROUP_PRIORITY_MEDIUM.\n\nAs the sole user of that uAPI lives in Mesa and hardcode a value of\nMEDIUM [1], this should be safe to do.\n\nAdditionally, as those checks are performed at the ioctl level,\npanthor_group_create now only check for priority level validity.\n\n[1]https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/f390835074bdf162a63deb0311d1a6de527f9f89/src/gallium/drivers/panfrost/pan_csf.c#L1038",
